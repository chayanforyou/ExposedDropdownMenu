# Exposed Dropdown Menu
Exposed dropdown menus display the currently selected menu item above the list of options. Some variations can accept user-entered input.

Note: The exposed dropdown menu is implemented through the _`TextInputLayout`_. For detailed information on [Material text fields](https://material.io/design/components/text-fields.html) and their usage, see the [TextInputLayout documentation](https://www.github.com/material-components/material-components-android/tree/master/docs/components/TextField.md).
